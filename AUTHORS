All people who contributed to SymPy Gamma by sending at least a patch or
more (in the order of the date of their first contribution), except those
who explicitly didn't want to be mentioned.  You can find missing people
from this file by using git log --reverse --format="%aN <%aE>" | awk '
!x[$0]++' (the order from that command will be a little different, but close
to the order here).  People with a * next to their names are not found in
the metadata of the git history.
